      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we introduced the idea of git and basic commands for individual version control (git add, git commit, git push, git pull). There will be a follow-up workshop on how to collaborate with teammates using branching, issues and pull requests. As we intend to have this workshop in person, practice exercises such as merging each other&amp;rsquo;s pull requests can be more fun while working side by side.&lt;/p&gt;
